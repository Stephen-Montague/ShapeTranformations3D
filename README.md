# ShapeTranformations3D

Created for the study of Computer Graphics.

Performs these tasks:

1. Reads a set of 3d vector points from a file 
2. Draws them as 3d shapes via a library draw function
3. Applies via matrix operations these transformations:

    Scale in / out
    Translate up / down / left / right
    Rotate up / down / left / right

Core functionality is here, however, running it depends on a private commercial game engine, from WebFoot Games, made available via Lewis University.
